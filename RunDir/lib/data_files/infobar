INFOBAR

Toggles the status bar at the bottom of your screen.  In order for it to work
right, you must be using terminal that can emulate VT100, and your screen must
have 24 rows.  You also must select "Y" for ANSI/VT100 on the main menu.  If
your screen gets messed up, type RESET to clear it and rewrite the infobar.
